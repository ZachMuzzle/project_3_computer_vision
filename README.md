# Computer Vision Project 3

## This Project Has Two Parts
* Part 1 will use 3 convolutional layers, 2 fully connected layers, max pooling and the RELU function.
Using 30 epochs we will train from scratch and try to find the best accuracy using our giving method.

* Part 2 will use the 5 provided images. We will semantic segmatation on the image. We will display the 21 feature maps then display the 1 picture
with different color that point to that object.

## How to Run Program
* For part 1 please viist [Part 1 README](part1_README/README.md)
* For part 2 please vist [Part 2 README](part2_README/README.md)
