# Project Title

PR3-Part1

## Description

Using the script part1.py. We will use 3 convolutional layers, 2 fully connected layers, max pooling and the RELU function.
Using 30 epochs we will train from scratch and try to find the best accuracy using our giving method.


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python3.8, all the given libaries used in the program, Windows 10

### Installing

*Use the provided cifar100 line of code that will download the given dataset.

### Executing program

* When using pycharm or any other ide. The program should be able to run once ran
* You can try to run as a command prompt using windows,linux, ubuntu if you so choose, but I have not tried to do that.

# Answers to questions

## Part b

* I used a kernel size of (5,5) and a default stride.

## Part c

* The pooling kernel size was (2,2)

## Part d

* The learning rate was 0.01, momentum was 0.5, and batch size was 16 for training and 256 for testing.

## Part e

* Accuracy after 30 epochs was 31 percent. With 156 correct predictions out of a total of 500.
